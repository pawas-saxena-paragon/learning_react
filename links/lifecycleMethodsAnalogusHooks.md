React introduced Hooks with React version 16.8, and Hooks provide a new way to use state and lifecycle features in functional components. With the introduction of Hooks, many class-based lifecycle methods become less relevant or are not used in functional components.

Here's how Hooks affect the relevance of traditional lifecycle methods in React:

1. **`componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount`:**
   - In class components, these lifecycle methods are used for side effects, data fetching, and cleanup.
   - In functional components, you can achieve the same functionality using the `useEffect` Hook. The `useEffect` Hook allows you to perform side effects in a functional component, and it replaces `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount` combined.

   ```javascript
   import React, { useEffect } from 'react';

   function MyComponent() {
     useEffect(() => {
       // componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate logic
       return () => {
         // componentWillUnmount logic
       };
     }, [/* dependencies */]);

     return (
       // Component render logic
     );
   }
   ```

2. **`shouldComponentUpdate`:**
   - In class components, `shouldComponentUpdate` is used to optimize rendering by preventing unnecessary updates.
   - In functional components, you can use the `React.memo` higher-order component or the `useMemo` Hook to achieve similar optimization. These tools allow you to memoize the result of a component based on its props.

   ```javascript
   import React, { useMemo } from 'react';

   const MemoizedComponent = React.memo(({ prop1, prop2 }) => {
     // Component logic
   });

   function MyComponent({ prop1, prop2 }) {
     const memoizedComponent = useMemo(() => <MemoizedComponent prop1={prop1} prop2={prop2} />, [prop1, prop2]);

     return (
       // Component render logic
       {memoizedComponent}
     );
   }
   ```

3. **`getDerivedStateFromProps` and `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate`:**
   - These lifecycle methods are used for more advanced scenarios involving state derived from props or capturing information before an update.
   - In functional components, you may use `useEffect` and manage the derived state or capture information within the component logic directly.

   ```javascript
   import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

   function MyComponent({ prop }) {
     const [derivedState, setDerivedState] = useState(null);

     useEffect(() => {
       // Logic to update derived state based on prop changes
     }, [prop]);

     return (
       // Component render logic
     );
   }
   ```

In summary, while traditional lifecycle methods are still valid in class components, Hooks provide a more concise and expressive way to handle the same concerns in functional components. The use of Hooks has become the standard in modern React development, making many class-based lifecycle methods less relevant in new codebases.
